<p>This application takes a search phrase and a URL. A Google search is made with the search phrase for the first 100 results. 
    The positions that the given URL occurs in these search results is then displayed in a comma separated list. 
    For example, the output of "1, 10, 33" means that the URL is present in the 1st 10th and 33rd search results. 
    If the URL is not present in any of the search results then the output is "0".</p>
