# Tech Test

[![.NET](https://github.com/gchurch/TechTest/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/gchurch/TechTest/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

The application I have created is an ASP.NET Core Web API and front-end Angular SPA. I use Selenium in order to get the HTML of the Google results pages so that I can scrape the URLs. I created a few services in order to separate concerns and make the code easier to unit test. I wrote a few unit tests and integration tests.

I have used .NET 5.0.

To run the application:
Open the solution in Visual Studio and press start.

In the UI, enter the search phrase and URL you want to use and then press the Search button.
