# URL Search Tech Test

I have completed the URL search project.

The application I created is an ASP.NET Core Web API and front-end Angular SPA. In the UI, enter the search phrase and url you want to use and then press the search button.

I have used .NET 5.0.

To run:
Open the solution in Visual Studio and press start.

I have tried cloning a new instance of the application and running it and it ran fine.
